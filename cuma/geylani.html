<hr>

<h3>The First Letter</h3>
<div class="pre">My dear friend!

When the lightning bolts of direct perception [shuhud] come flashing forth from the cloud-bank of the grace of:

Allah guides to His Light  whomever He will.   (24:35)

--and the fragrant scents of attainment waft on the wind that blows from the gracious favor of:

He singles out for His mercy  whomever He will. (3:74)

--the sweet-smelling plants of intimate friendship will blossom in the meadows of our hearts, and the nightingales of longing will sing in the gardens of our spirits, with the tremulous tones of:

Oh, how I grieve for Joseph!  (12:84)

The fires of yearning will smolder intensely in the stoves of our innermost beings, and the wings of the birds of our thoughts will shed their feathers, from flying too far in the vastness of sublime exaltation.

The stallions of our minds will lose their way in the deserts of intuitive knowledge, the foundations of our intellectual principles will quake from the shock of awe, and the ships of our firm intentions will lose their bearings in the depths of the oceans of:

They did not assign to Allah  the attributes that are due to Him. (6:91)


So it sailed with them in the  midst of mountain-like waves. (11:42)

--and at the moment when the waves collide in the ocean of the ardor of:

He loves them and they love  Him.  (5:54)

--each and every one will exclaim, in the spiritual tongue that needs no ordinary words [lisan al-hal]:

My Lord, bring me to land in  a blessed harbor, for You are the Best of harborers! (23:29)

So then they will receive, as a foreordained gift, the gracious favor of:

As for those to whom the  [reward] most fair has already gone forth from Us.... (21:101)

--and it will bring them ashore on [Mount] Judi, a trustworthy landing site [maq'ad sidq].

It will introduce them to the sessions of the delirious ecstatics of the Day of:

"Am I not...?"  (7:172)

It will spread for them the table-mat of the bounty of:

To those who do good belongs  the finest--and an extra reward! (10:26)

--and it will pass to them the cups of attainment, filled from the jugs of nearness, by the hands of the cupbearers of:

And their Lord will quench  their thirst with a pure drink. (76:21)

They will thus be honored with the everlasting estate and the endlessly enduring fortune of:

And when you see, there you  will see a state of bliss and a great domain. (76:20)

<h3>The Fifth Letter</h3>
<div class="pre">My dear friend!

When the suns of our spiritual experiences [ma'arif] rise from their points of ascension in the skies of our innermost beings, the earths of our hearts will be illumined by the light of:

And the earth will shine with  the light of its Lord. (39:69)

--and the coverings of the darkness of ignorance will be removed from the eyes of our minds, with the ointment of:

But now We have removed from  you your covering. (50:22)

The eyes of our inward intellects will then be dazzled by the radiant emanations of the lights of holiness [al-quds]. Our processes of thought will wonder in amazement, at the disclosure of the marvelous secrets of the realm of the spiritual kingdom [al-malakut].

Excited by the thrill of ardent love [al-'ishq], the seeker will go a-wandering in the deserts of the quest. Then, in the sites of nearness, the raptures of yearning [ghalabat ash-shawq] will become familiar to him, and the herald of:

Allah is truly Bountiful  toward mankind. (10:60)

--will proclaim:

And He is with you wherever  you may be. (57:4)

Once he has discovered the secret of 'togetherness' [al-ma'iyya], the seeker will lose his personal existence, in compliance with the dictate of:

And do not set together with  Allah another god. (51:51)

As soon as he has plunged into the sea of the personal extinction [fana'] of:

No part of the matter is your  concern. (3:128)

--so that he may obtain the jewel of the affirmation of Oneness [tawhid], the waves of solicitude [ghaira] will fling him into the ocean of sublimity ['azama]. Each time he makes for the shore, in the plight of bewilderment, he must say:

My Lord, I have wronged  myself, so forgive me! (28:16)

--for then he will be picked up by the rescue vessels of the kind favors of:

And We have carried them on  land and sea. (17:70)

--and they will set him down on the beach of the the tender kindness of:

We visit with Our mercy whom  We will.  (12:56)

They will hand him the keys to the treasure houses of the mysteries of:

And Allah is always  encompassing all things. (4:126)

--and they will point out to him the indications of:

And that unto your Lord is  the final destination. (53:42)

He will thereby come to know the meaning of:

And He revealed to His  servant that which He revealed. (53:10)

--and he will understand the implication of:

Indeed, he saw one of the  greatest signs of his Lord. (53:18)

<h3>The Sixth Letter</h3>
<div class="pre">My dear friend!

When the armies of the providential ecstasies [jadhabat] of:

Allah chooses for Himself  whomever He will. (42:13)

--have conquered the government of our hearts, they will humble and exercise the arrogant aspirations of our domineering selves [an-nufus al-ammara] with the bridles of the training of:

And strive for Allah's sake  with all the effort He deserves. (22:78)

They will confine the tyrants of passion inside the prison of dutiful devotion [taqwa], bound in the chains of strenuous exertion [mujahada], and they will shackle the Pharaohs of desire with the fetters of:

Obey Allah and obey the  Messenger. (4:59)

They will chastise the agents of our wishes and our preferences with the discipline of:

He who does wrong will have  the recompense thereof. (4:123)

They will completely demolish the innovations that constitute our conventional habits and customary practices, along with the foundations that support the pillars of fraud and deception. The herald of the spiritual state [munadi 'l-hal] will proclaim, in the language of veracity [lisan as-sidq]:

Kings, when they enter a  township, ruin it and make the noblest of its people the lowest. (27:34)

The courtyard of our hearts will thus be purified and cleansed of the stain made by the filthy refuse of the house of:

If anyone desires anything  other than Islam as a religion, it will never be accepted of him. (3:85)

--the gardens of our spirits will acquire a fragrance from the breezes of the gracious favors of:

He whom Allah guides, he is  indeed the one who is guided aright. (7:178) 

--the surfaces of the leaves of our innermost beings will be engraved with the calligraphic markings of the subtleties of:

As for such, He has written  faith upon their hearts. (58:22)

--and the lamp of our consciences will become the mirror of the lightning bolts of direct vision, through the shining rays of the lights of:

And Allah will perfect His  light. (61:8)

The spiritual state of the seeker will then fit the description of how it is to be:

On the day when the earth  will be changed to other than this earth.  (14:48)

The seemingly unshakable mountains of his ardent yearnings will disintegrate into scattered particles of dust [haba'an manthura], and he will say with the tongue of truthfulness:

And you will see the  mountains, which you suppose to be solidly fixed, flying by with the flight of clouds.  (27:88)

The Israfil of intense love ['ishq] will blow the trumpet of:

And the Trumpet will be  blown. (39:68)

--until there is no longer any mystery about the stunning cause of:

So whoever is in the heavens  and whoever is in the earth will swoon away. (39:68)

Then, just in time, the announcer of the good fortune of:

The greatest terror will not grieve them. (21:103)

--will arrive to reinvigorate them. He will summon them to the highest heaven ['Illiyyun], a sure abode [maq'ad sidq]. As he delivers the glad tidings of:

Good news for you this day.  (57:12)

--he will open for them the gates of the Gardens of Delight, and he will say:

Peace be upon you. Well you  have fared, so enter in, to dwell therein forever. (39:73)

--and they will say: 

Praise be to Allah, who has fulfilled His promise to us, and has caused us to inherit the land, for us to make our  dwelling wherever we will in the Garden [of Paradise]. How splendid is the wage of those  who labor! (39:74)
